# About Me
My name is Jacob Leiser. I'm a business data analyst with 2 years' consultancy experience in the Global Data IT at a multinational company and have a background in quantitative psychological research. This website gives some background information about my interests and details of the data projects I have undertaken. It is a work in progress with some sections still to be added.

#Coding and Data
I was first introduced to coding at University with R being taught as the main method of data analysis in the research  process. I really enjoyed learning R and became very confident in a number of processes: data manipulation, wrangling, analysis and visualisation. Through this, I gained experience of git and version control (used to make this website).

As part of the consultant programme at Kubrick Group, I received three months of training before client work. This training included SQL, Alteryx (for which I received the Design Core Certification), Tableau and Python. After training I joined Avon's Global Data IT Team as a business data analyst. I have significantly developed my SQL skills in this role with the cloud-based data platform Snowflake being the global database for Avon's data. In the future I hope to work more with data visualisation tools such as Tableau or Power BI. 

As a side project, I'm self-studying Swift language and iOS app development in Xcode. I'm thoroughly enjoying learning this from scratch and look forward to building my first app, hopefully later in 2022.

# Work Experience
I joined Kubrick Group as a data product consultant in February 2020. We received three months of training with technical aspects as described above as well as business skills such as stakeholder management, requirements gathering and engineering, presentation and Agile methodology.

Upon finishing training, I joined Avon as a business data analyst. Through this role I have had a number of roles such as leading my team in a high-profile project introducing new data streams to users. For this project, I refined the initial requirements, tested the data ingestion process, built user views in line with the data architecture best practices and ran the UAT process. I have also ran data quality checks comparing discrepancies between the global database and local systems. One of the most common tasks I perform is creating outbound interfaces, typically implementing business logic into Snowflake functions with the data to be extracted to reporting or marketing tools and accessed by up to 3 million reps.

Before Kubrick Group, I worked for 2.5 years at the Priory Hospital in Glasgow. This is a mental health facility which cares for three main clinical groups: general psychiatry (primarily anxiety and depression), addictions and eating disorders. As well as my role as a Healthcare Assistant, I was also the head research assistant for a collaborative Priory/NHS study investigating mediators of the relationship between childhood trauma and alcohol misuse in later life. You can read more about this project and my role in it [here](priory.html).

I also had a 2 month internship at a London-based market research company Bryter. It was great to get experience of the different ways data is used in this industry.

# Education
In December 2019, I graduated with a Distinction (1st) in the 'Research Methods of Psychological Science' MSc course from the University of Glasgow. This followed on from my undergraduate Psychology course from the same university, from which I graduated with a 2:1 in 2018. 

Both the undergraduate and masters courses were quantitatively-focused and I developed my coding skills through specific classes such as 'Statistics', 'Advanced Statistics' and 'Data Skills for Reproducible Science'. 
The analysis I used for the dissertation project of each degree was carried out using R. You can read all about my Masters dissertation and see the code I used throughout the process to initially manipulate the data into a clean format and then to analyse it [here](eyetrack.html) and click [here](sleep.html) to find out more about my undergraduate dissertation.

# Interests
I am a keen fan of football, music and film. I love being outdoors and try to take advantage of the great hills around Glasgow and hike when the weather allows it. Another strong interest of mine is video games of all kinds - sports, open-world RPGs or smaller puzzle games. 

During the covid lockdowns in 2020 and 2021, I undertook some small data projects to get accustomed to using new technologies. You can read more about these [here](interests.html)
