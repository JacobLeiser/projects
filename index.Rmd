I am a Masters student who recently graduated with Distinction from the Research Methods of Psychological Science MSc from the University of Glasgow. I have a strong foundation of qualitative science and am interested in a career in data science.

This website is a platform where I showcase the projects I have worked on and code that I have written that was used in these projects as well as future projects I am interested in working on.
