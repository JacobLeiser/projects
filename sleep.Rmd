title: "Are Sleep Quality and Risk Taking Related in a General Population?"
---

When finished, this page will highlight the full research process of my undergraduate dissertation project which was titled "Sleep Quality and Risk Taking in a General Population". I worked with multiple forms of data and I will show and explain the code I wrote to organise and prepare this data for analysis. Additionally, I will show the process by which I edited existing Python code (found on Github) of the behavioural task used in my study to the specifications I required. This was my first experience of Python code so the process was akin to reverse-engineering.
