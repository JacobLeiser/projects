title: "Smaller Data Projects"
---

During the covid lockdowns throughout 2020 I took on a few small data projects in different technologies. 

One that was quite fun to do involved the goals scored by a favourite streamer of mine with his club in Pro Evolution Soccer. I wanted to practice making interesting, dynamic charts in Tableau so created the following animated chart which shows the number of goals scored by players over time:

I also carried out a lot of small analyses in Alteryx just looking into things that interest me like music and sports. Unfortunately, given that I don't use it at work, I no longer have a valid license for Alteryx so can't access the outputs of these.
