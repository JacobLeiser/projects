title: "Research Interests and Future Projects"
---

When finished, this page will discuss specific research interests I have and projects I hope to undertake in the future. I will regularly update the website as I conduct more research and will show the code I have used. I hope to learn more about Machine Learning and other programs and languages such as Python and Tableau. In the future I would like to combine my interests of football and data to investigate various elements within the game such as identifying key factors that impact attendances such as ticket price, volume of televised games and average number of goals scored in matches. I am also very eager to learn more about data visualisation and would like to produce interesting and visually appealing graphs.
