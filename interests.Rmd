title: "Research Interests and Future Projects"
---

This is a page where I talk about my research interests in data science and future projects I would like to conduct.

As a keen fan of sports, I would be very interested in working with football data. I like companies like Opta and that Sports Science one. 

I would also love to work with online music streaming data, for example spotify as I think people's music trends can tell a lot about the person.
