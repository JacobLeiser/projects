title: "What Factors Mediate the Relationship between Childhood Trauma and Alcohol Misuse?"

When finished, this page will provide an overview of my role in the Priory and NHS collaborative research project which I was involved in. The study was titled "Examination of Shame and Early Maladaptive Schemas as Mediators of the Relationship between Childhood Trauma and Severity of Alcohol Misuse". My role was data collection and then dissemination so I was crucially involved throughout the process. 

I will explain my involvement in further detail but generally I recruited participants from The Priory Hospital in Glasgow and assisted them in completing a battery of questionnaires. Once the data had been analysed by the head researcher, Dr Joanne Halcrow of NHS Tayside, I presented the results to a diverse audience of healthcare professionals as part of a CPD presentation.
